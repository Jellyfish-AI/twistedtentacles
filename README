# WELCOME TO THE JELLYFISH FORWARD DEPLOYED ENGINEERING INTERVIEW

# The following is a breakdown of the relevant files/folders

    Folder: company_files -> a collections of files that associate 1:1 with companies. 
        *  These files are used to apply client specific transformations/changes to the data.
        *  They are named using the 'slug' property on the Company object

    Folder: helper_functions -> a collection of GET functions designed to assist in the fetching of specific data

    Folder: models -> contains the models.py file which contains the definitions of all the relevant data classes being used

    Folder: process_data: -> contains functions for processing and displaying the most recent order information 

    Folder: stored_data -> contains the latest order forms as well as the "db" data.py

    
    File: utils -> contains helper functions for importing and using @company_specific_function tags

    File: main.py -> processes, transforms and prints a receipt for the most recent order form
    

# These assumptions can be made 

    1. All of the existing functions work as intended (unless otherwise noted)
    2. The data in stored_data will not change and will remain the same throughout each test
    3. All company specific processing will happen in the respective company .py file
    4. Company .py files are named with the same slug as the company object
    5. A Company "slug" is a unique string identifier used to represent a company
